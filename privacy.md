Privacy Policy

The app you are using is called Predict My4D. We hate legalese, so we've tried to make this policy readable. If you've got any questions, feel free to ask us, and we'll do our best to answer. 


A) Personal Data

We do not require users to create accounts to use our mobile app. We do not store your data and information. We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even have a server database to store it. Therefore, with Predict My4D, it is safe for you to know that your personal data will not be given or used by us.

B) Billing Data

Predict My4D mobile app is entirely free to use. We do not offer any in-app purchases nor do we offer paid products within our app. Therefore, you are not required to disclose Billing Data to download the mobile app. 

C) Marketing

Generally, we may serve third party ads in our products for mobile devices.

To be able to offer you our services for free, we show third party ads within your mobile apps through popular ad networks, which are listed below. We display an AdChoices logo on top of every ad. You can tap the icon to learn more about the ad network.

To enable the ad, we embed a third-party software development kit (SDK) for these ads. The SDK code is provided by third party ad agencies or networks.

Data of our mobile users remain anonymous to us and to the third party ad agencies. However, the ad agencies’ SDK code will collect data to tailor ads to you, such as the third-party apps you installed on your device, your Android advertising identifier, your IP Address, your device's operating system details and MAC address, and other statistical and technical information. You can find more information in each network’s privacy policy, the link to which we are also including in the overview below.

Predict My 4D uses AdMob ad network by google as its choice to show third party ads within the mobile app. Policies for these ad providers can be found respectively:

D) Online Identifiers

The GUID is a randomly generated number that we assign to each installation of software. As the mobile app is entirely fee and there is no Billing Data collected by us, the us GUID is disconnected from personal data.

The GUID is used for many purposes, which will be described in this Privacy Policy.

We use analytical tools, including third party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns. While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners, their tools which we use, as well as additional information on where and how we use them.

(1) Google Analytics by Google:

Our apps use Google Analytics to allow us to understand how our users use and interact with our products and how to improve our products. Where our apps use Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs, Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier — a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an app. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset. Where our apps have implemented Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like AdWords, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Google Analytics also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give us a sense of which country, state, or city in the world our users come from (also known as "IP geolocation"). We do implement measures and best practices in order to avoid sending personal data when collecting Analytics Data such as: Safeguarding our data, IP Anonymization, IP masking, data retention, user deletion and access management.

(2) Firebase Analytics by Google:

Firebase Analytics is a service that helps us understand our users and how they use apps including information about interactions with the user's mobile applications. Firebase Analytics uses identifiers for advertising on mobile applications (for example, Android Advertising ID and Identifier for Advertisers for iOS - IDFA), and we will collect the AAID and IDFA for these above-mentioned purposes. Users who wish to opt-out of the AAID and IDFA advertisement tracking can do so through device advertising settings for mobile apps within your device and users who wish to avoid tracking by Firebase Analytics can opt-out in application settings. Data collected will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers globally.

(3) Firebase Crash Reporting by Google:

To improve the stability of mobile applications, we use crash reporting services to collect information about the devices that you use and your use of our applications (for example the timestamp of when you launched the application and when the crash occurred) which enables us to diagnose and resolve problems. This allows us to deliver to you stable, functioning services and improve our applications in the future. The data collected does not contain any information which can personally identify you. The data will be transmitted to and stored by Google (Firebase Crash Reporting and Fabric Crashlytics) on servers globally.
